# Introduction to plugins

A plugin is a file that modifies how the server works.

Every plugin is located in the `plugins` folder.

## Create a plugin

To create a plugin, you must use the official API.
It was designed to use the same conventions of other Minecraft API like Spigot, Fabric or Minestom.
More precisely, every plugin works with events and the API is very similar to dataflow programming.
